                              For risk management purpose, PowerCARD introduces the mechanism of card limits. Card limits are the maximum amount that cardholders can either withdraw in an ATM machine or also use to make a purchase via internet, terminal pos… Those limits are defined in PowerCARD as a package identified by a unique index. That index could be either linked to a particular card or also linked a range or a product and by the way the entire cards in this range or having such product inherit the characteristics of that index.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              The index is constituted from a set of setup, each setup is intended to refer to a different transaction types. Within each setup, a daily and periodic limit amounts are shared to give an overview of the limits that should not be exceeded.

                               Usually a card is automatically renewed within the month it expires. However, for some reasons, as if when the customer is going to be out of the town during the renewal process, he may request to renew his card before its expiration date. For that, PowerCARD offers the possibility to use this web service. The service is mainly used to store the request that will be processed during the end of the day. 
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              It is important to mention here that PowerCARD makes multiple controls on the card before proceeding to perform the renewal action. Those controls are all defined in the system and can be activated or deactivated by the financial institution using the PowerCARD setup screens.
