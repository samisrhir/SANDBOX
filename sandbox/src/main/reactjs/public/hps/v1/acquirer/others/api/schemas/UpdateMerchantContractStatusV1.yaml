      description:  <h3>API Overview</h3>
                    <p>PowerCARD offers a comprehensive merchant management module that enables users to create and maintain merchants in the system. </p>
                    <p>The present web service aims to update the status of a merchant contract element. The change in status of a Contract Element has no effect on the status of the merchant. However, change of an ELC status has an effect on all the attached services. Thus, the closing action of an ELC is reflected by deactivation on the attached services, and the actions of activation/deactivation of ELC are reflected by activation/deactivation on the attached services.</p>
                    <p>Acceptance optional services are not affected by the status change of the ELC to which they are attached. An acceptance optional service may be in normal status and active independently of the ELC to which it is attached.</p>
