      description:  <h3>API Overview</h3>
                    <p>The present API provides functionality to allocate a device to a terminal in the system.</p>
                    <p>While invoking this API, the system assigns a device serial number as well as a brand identification code to the logical terminal. It is worth to note that one device can be assigned to only one terminal, attempting to assign the same device to another terminal will be followed by a rejection with a specific error code. </p>
                    <h3>Functional Description</h3>
