      description:  <h3>API Overview</h3>
                    <p>The present API provides functionality to allocate a device to a terminal in the system.</p>
                    <p>While invoking this API, the system assigns a device serial number as well as a brand identification code to the logical terminal. It is worth to note that one device can be assigned to only one terminal, attempting to assign the same device to another terminal will be followed by a rejection with a specific error code. </p>

                    <p>Users have the ability to create a logical representation of the POS terminal in the system thank to this API. The said API provides functionality to capture a new POS terminal along with set a data that identify uniquely the terminal in the system. Including but not limited to information like floor limit amounts per supported currency, supported languages, POS location…. Please note that in a later stage this terminal need to be assigned uniquely to an existing device with a unique serial number. This association helps to setting up a link between the hardware and its definition in the system.</p>
