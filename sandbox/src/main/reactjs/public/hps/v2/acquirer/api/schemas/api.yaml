      description:  <h3>API Overview</h3>
                    <p>PowerCard Connect'API uses JWT authentication for securing the exposed REST APIs, the user will be able to consume API TokenAuthentification only if it has a valid Token.</p>
                    <p>The Connect’API authenticates all requests using the token available in the request itself, If such an authentication fails, Connect’API simply sends an HTTP code 401 (Unauthorized).</p>
