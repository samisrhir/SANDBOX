                          <p>
                              For risk management purpose, PowerCARD introduces the mechanism of card limits. Card limits are the maximum amount that cardholders can either withdraw in an ATM machine or also use to make a purchase via internet, terminal posâ€¦ Those limits are defined in PowerCARD as a package identified by a unique index. That index could be either linked to a particular card or also linked a range or a product and by the way the entire cards in this range or having such product inherit the characteristics of that index.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              The index is constituted from a set of setup, each setup is intended to refer to a different transaction types. Within each setup, a daily and periodic limit amounts are shared to give an overview of the limits that should not be exceeded. 
                          </p>
