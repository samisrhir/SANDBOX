                          <p>
                          The search loan web service is an API that can be used to retrieve all the loans provided by the issuer to the customer. Whether it is an ongoing loan or an amortized one, this service provides the ability to search for all existing loans in the system using different criteria’s like Transaction Id, Account Id or also transaction date. For the last criteria, users must specify a range of dates values to get the list of loans submitted between those two dates, for instance search for the list of loans submitted today, last week, last months… 
                          </p>
