                        <h3>API Overview</h3>
                          <p>
                               Usually a card is automatically renewed within the month it expires. However, for some reasons, as if when the customer is going to be out of the town during the renewal process, he may request to renew his card before its expiration date. For that, PowerCARD offers the possibility to use this web service. The service is mainly used to store the request that will be processed during the end of the day. 
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              It is important to mention here that PowerCARD makes multiple controls on the card before proceeding to perform the renewal action. Those controls are all defined in the system and can be activated or deactivated by the financial institution using the PowerCARD setup screens.
                          </p>
